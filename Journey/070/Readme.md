# Day 70

Continued with the AWS CloudFormation 101 workshop and learned about AWS Systems Manager Session Manager, how to manage an EC2 instance through it. Went off on a tangent to figure out how to actually secure that access to specific IAM users.

The answer lies somewhere in these other two docs pages. Not sure which of my changes actually made the difference, though. Neither was a complete solution.
