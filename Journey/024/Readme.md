# Day 24

Watched the (always amazing) FooBar Serverless video from [Marcia Villalba](https://twitter.com/mavi888uy) with her guest [Nader Dabit](https://twitter.com/dabit3), "AMPLIFY AND DYNAMODB WITH PERFORMANCE IN MIND". Discovered `amplify mock` for testing Amplify services like graphql APIs and functions locally. YAY! What a lifesaver.
