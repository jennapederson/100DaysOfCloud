# Day 29

Worked through some more AWS IAM concepts (AWS managed, customer-managed, and inline policies, cross-account access) and Amazon CloudWatch monitoring and alarms. Also, reviewed the different AWS services with "cloud" in the name using [Christina Gorton's](https://twitter.com/coffeecraftcode) post, [All the Clouds in AWS](https://dev.to/exampro/all-the-clouds-in-aws-205n).
