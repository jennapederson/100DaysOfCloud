# Day 15

Started reviewing CI & CD concepts and learning more about AWS CodeCommit and CodeDeploy.

# Unexpected findings

I didn't realize the D in CD could stand for either Delivery or Deployment. Now I've got to remember which one is which!

Continuous Delivery - there's a human decision involved in whether or not to deploy
Continuous Deployment - the decision is automated and code is deployed as soon as it's ready and tested
