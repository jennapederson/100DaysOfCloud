# Day 23

Switched back to working through A Cloud Guru's [Certified Developer Associate](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-developer-associate) course today and learned more about AWS CodeBuild and AWS CloudFormation. Worked through a couple labs to build, tag, and push a Docker container to an Elastic Container Registery with the CLI and CodeBuild and to launch it with ECS. Used CloudFormation to provision an EC2 instance.
