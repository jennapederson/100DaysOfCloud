# Day 45

Rolled through [this](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/jump-starting-your-serverless-development-environment/) from [@benjamin_l_s](https://twitter.com/benjamin_l_s) to get my environment set up for proper and productive serverless development. Touched on AWS CLI, AWS SAM CLI, AWS Toolkit for VSCode, linters, DynamoDB data modeling and visualization, and the AWS Lambda power tuner.
