# Day 28

Finished the Developer Theory module and started on the Advanced IAM module on A Cloud Guru's [Certified Developer Associate](https://acloud.guru/learn/aws-certified-developer-associate) course. Solidified some of my learnings from earlier this week on web identity federation, Cognito user and identity pools.
